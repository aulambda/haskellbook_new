# Haskell Programming from First Principles
*Book by Julie Moronuki and Chris Allen
Notes by @aulambda*
October 2016

The [last time](https://github.com/aulambda/haskellbook/commits?author=aulambda) I started working through this book I left off around chapter 10. It was so fun and gratifying, but other things got in the way and I ended up pausing for a few months. Felt the urge to pick it back up today so I'm going to try and start learning again. I'm reviewing the first 8 chapters by taking notes and solving *most* of the exercises again, and then I'll start in earnest going through the chapters fully @ chapter 9.


## 1 Lambda Calculus
Functional Programming
  : Programming focused on the combination of expressions, particularly functions. Expressions can be values, variable, or functions.
Functions
  : Expressions that are applied to an argument or input and evaluated to return a result. The result isn't an action that the funtion does, but rather the true value of the function, the process of moving from a stated function to the final expression that expresses the value of the function is called *reduction* or *evaluation*
Purity
  : Referential transparency. A pure function, given the same values, will always return the same result, no concept of *state*.
