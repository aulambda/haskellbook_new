# Haskell Programming from First Principles
This is a record of my attempt to study the book [Haskell Programming from First Principles](http://haskellbook.com). I am a relatively inexperienced programmer who is learning Haskell through this book as my first real foray into programming and this repository contains my solutions to the exercises in the book as well as some occasional notes as I solve problems and grow in my understanding.

I can't reccomend the book highly enough. If you are interested in Haskell, please give it a try, particularly if you have little or no programming experience. The book is well suited to novice and experienced programmers, but is uniquely delightful when read not just as an introduction to Haskell, but also as an introduction to programming in general.

I hope my solutions are helpful to others, please use anything you find here however you need.
